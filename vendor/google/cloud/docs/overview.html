<p>
  First, install the <code>Google Cloud Client Library</code> with composer and require it into your project:
</p>
<div hljs>$ composer require google/cloud</div>
<p>
  If you are running your app on Google Compute Engine, you won't need to worry about supplying connection configuration options to the library&mdash; we figure that out for you.
</p>
<p>
  However, if you're running your app elsewhere, you will need to provide project details to authenticate API requests.
</p>
<div hljs hljs-language="php" no-escape>
use Google\Cloud\ServiceBuilder;

// Compute Engine
$gcloud = new ServiceBuilder([
    'projectId' => 'myProject'
]);

// Elsewhere
$gcloud = new ServiceBuilder([
    'keyFilePath' => '/path/to/key/file.json',
    'projectId' => 'myProject'
]);

// Fetch an instance of the Storage Client
$storage = $gcloud->storage();</div>
<p>
  The full set of options which can be passed to the ServiceBuilder and sub-modules are <a href="#/docs">outlined here</a>.
